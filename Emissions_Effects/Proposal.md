Members: Steven, Stefani, Amy

# Summary

Datasources: CalEnviroScreen, Historical Air Quality data from EPA

Focusing on counties in the Bay Area and Central California, we'll be using historical and current air quality data from the CalEnviroScreen project and the US EPA

How do urban versus rural air pollutants differ (type and/or amount)
How do air pollutant levels relate to traffic data, highway locations
Are there any distinctive hot spots?

# Rough Schedule

Wednesday (4/11): Databases selected, data dictionaries for each database. By end of class period, identify variables we want to use, begin data exploration

Saturday (4/14): By end of class, have the dataframes explored and cleaned up in preparation for analysis. Split up analysis work so that we're each working on answering a different question or different aspect of question

Monday (4/16): Have each of our analyses ready for other group members to look at, ask follow up questions, begin write up and presentation
