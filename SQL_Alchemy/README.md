# SQLAlechemy Practice

This is a project to familiarize with sqlalchemy by creating an sqlite database, filling it with data from csvs, and then performing analysis/visualization on that data. The data is taken from weather observation stations in Hawaii and is analyzed for trip planning.

"data_engineering.ipynb" examines and cleans the csv data.

"database_engineering.ipynb" creates and populates the sqlite database.

"climate_analysis.ipynb" is where the analysis is performed using queries to the sqlite db, custom functions, and visualizations.
